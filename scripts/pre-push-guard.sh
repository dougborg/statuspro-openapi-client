# Pre-push guard: refuse pushes that land non-main commits on the `main` ref.
#
# Why this exists: when a feature branch is created via
#   git checkout -b <name> origin/main
# git sets the new local branch's upstream to origin/main. A subsequent
#   git push -u origin <name>
# resolves <name> to the tracked upstream and pushes straight to main. This
# pattern caused a real release-pipeline incident in our sister repo
# (katana-openapi-client commit 30f3fd86) before the guard was added there.
#
# pre-commit invokes this with the remote name as $1, the URL as $2, and
# `<local-ref> <local-sha> <remote-ref> <remote-sha>` lines on stdin.
#
# Bypass via --no-verify is forbidden by project policy (see CLAUDE.md). The
# right form for first-time feature-branch pushes is:
#   git push -u origin HEAD:refs/heads/<branch-name>

ERROR: refusing to push '$local_short' to remote 'main'.

This is almost always git's tracked-upstream resolution biting you — the
local branch was probably created via 'git checkout -b $local_short origin/main',
so its upstream is origin/main and a bare 'git push -u origin $local_short' targets main.

The fix: use an explicit destination ref so the remote branch name matches:

    git push -u origin HEAD:refs/heads/$local_short

If you genuinely need to push to main from a non-main branch (rare), do it
through a PR. Bypassing this hook with --no-verify is forbidden by project policy
— see CLAUDE.md 'Known Pitfalls'.

ERROR: refusing to push '$local_ref' to remote 'main'.

The local ref isn't a normal branch (got: $local_ref). Pushes to main from
anything other than the local 'main' branch are blocked.

If you intended to push your current work to a new feature branch:

    git push -u origin HEAD:refs/heads/<branch-name>

Then open a PR. Bypassing this hook with --no-verify is forbidden by project
policy — see CLAUDE.md 'Known Pitfalls'.
