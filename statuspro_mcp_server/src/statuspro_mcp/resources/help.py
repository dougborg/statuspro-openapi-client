# StatusPro MCP Server — Tool Reference

## Orders

| Tool | Endpoint | Purpose |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| `list_orders` | `GET /orders` | Paginated list with filters (search, status, tags, due-date range). Auto-paginates. `search` matches order number, name, or customer fields — use it to find an order from just an order number. **Gotchas:** (1) many orders may have NO `status` set — use `list_orders_in_workflow` if you only want orders StatusPro is actively tracking; (2) `financial_status`, `fulfillment_status`, and `tags` filter server-side but are NOT echoed back on results — filter for what you need rather than list-then-inspect. |
| `list_orders_in_workflow` | `GET /orders?status_code=…` xN (parallel, capped 10 concurrent) | Return only orders with a workflow status assigned. Iterates per defined status_code; merges results. Use when you want the operationally-tracked subset of orders, not the full list (which includes orders with no status set). |
| `get_order` | `GET /orders/{id}` | Full detail for one order, with the most recent `history_limit` history entries (default 50). When `history_truncated` is true, use `get_order_history` for older entries. |
| `get_order_history` | `GET /orders/{id}` (client-side paged) | Page through the full history timeline of one order. Use when `get_order` indicated truncation. |
| `get_orders_batch` | `GET /orders/{id}` xN (parallel fan-out) | Fetch up to 50 orders by id in one tool call. Returns per-id found/not-found results. Useful when an external system hands you a list of ids. |
| `lookup_orders_batch` | `GET /orders?search=` xN (parallel fan-out) | Resolve up to 50 order numbers to orders in one tool call. Marks ambiguous matches and not-founds explicitly. Use when you have order numbers but no ids. |
| `summarize_active_orders` | Multiple `GET /orders` requests (parallel, capped at 10 concurrent, cached 30s) | One-shot dashboard: counts of non-cancelled orders by workflow status, financial_status, and fulfillment_status. Internal cost is variable — 1 totals + 1 status-catalog + 1 per workflow status code + 8 financial_status counts + 4 fulfillment_status counts. |
| `get_viable_statuses` | `GET /orders/{id}/viable-statuses` | Valid status transitions for the order's current state. |
| `update_order_status` | `POST /orders/{id}/status` | Change status. Two-step confirm. Preview self-validates against viable transitions (one extra read to `GET /orders/{id}/viable-statuses`, cached) — invalid `status_code` is surfaced before the write `POST` that would 422. |
| `add_order_comment` | `POST /orders/{id}/comment` | Add a history comment. Two-step confirm. 5/min. |
| `update_order_due_date` | `POST /orders/{id}/due-date` | Change due date / date range. Two-step confirm. |
| `bulk_update_order_status` | `POST /orders/bulk-status` | Update up to 50 orders in one request. Two-step confirm. 5/min. |

## Statuses

| Tool | Endpoint | Purpose |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| `list_statuses` | `GET /statuses` | Full status catalog for the account. |

## Resources

- `statuspro://statuses` — JSON list of all defined statuses (cached read).
- `statuspro://help` — this document.

## Recommended workflow for status changes

```
get_order(order_id)                 # confirm you're targeting the right order
get_viable_statuses(order_id)       # discover the valid transitions
update_order_status(
    order_id=…, status_code=…,
    confirm=False,                  # preview
)
update_order_status(…, confirm=True)  # apply
```

## Input handling

List-typed parameters (`tags`, `tags_any`, `financial_status`,
`fulfillment_status`, `order_ids`, `order_numbers`) accept three input
shapes — pass whichever is most natural for the call:

- A real list: `["20486", "20487"]`
- A JSON-stringified array: `'["20486", "20487"]'`
- A comma-separated string: `"20486,20487"`

The CSV and JSON-string forms are normalized to a list before validation.
Empty / whitespace-only strings yield `[]`. Anything else (e.g. a bare
integer for a `list[int]` field) raises a normal pydantic type error.

## Rate limits

StatusPro documents rate limits per-endpoint in its OpenAPI description (not
in response headers). The client retries 429s with exponential backoff.

- Most endpoints: 60 requests/minute.
- `add_order_comment`, `bulk_update_order_status`: 5 requests/minute.
